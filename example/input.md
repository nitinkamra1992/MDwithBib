# Reading List

This is a reading list for literature on **multirobot task scheduling**.

## Main reading

Scheduling problems often arise in teams of robots trying to accomplish persistent tasks. For anyone trying to survey the field of multirobot task scheduling, this reading list describes some good resources to begin with.

Some early examples of persistent multirobot scheduling are the works [@Smith2010:cite; @MichaelStump2011:cite; @Toksoz2011:cite]. [@MichaelStump2011:authors] have designed a scheduling algorithm for persistent surveillance planning for teams of robots in their work [@MichaelStump2011:title]. [@Toksoz2011:author] have implemented automated battery swapping for multirobot systems and [@Smith2010:author] have studied the vehicle-routing problem for a team of two autonomous vehicles.

A more recent work by [@kamra2015mixed:authors] titled [@kamra2015mixed:title] combines all the above works to design a routing planner for a persistent multirobot system which involves many worker robots providing services and being kept alive by autonomous delivery robots continuously exchanging their batteries [@kamra2015mixed:cite]. For a detailed introductory text on operations research solutions to multirobot path planning and vehicle routing, see the book [@TothVigo2001:title] by [@TothVigo2001:author] [@TothVigo2001:cite].
